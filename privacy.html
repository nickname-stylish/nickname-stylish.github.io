  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Nickname Generator</strong></p>

  <p>
    At Nickname Generator, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy
    explains how information is handled when you use our application.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at
    <a href="mailto:nickgenapp@outlook.com">nickgenapp@outlook.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    The Nickname Generator app does not require users to create an account.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or transmit personal content such as names, text,
    nicknames, or generated results to our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    All text, nicknames, and generated content are stored locally on your device
    only and never leave your device.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The app may request access to certain device features (such as storage) only
    to enable app functionality, for example saving generated content.
  </p>
  <p>
    These permissions are used solely on your device. We do not access, collect,
    or upload this information.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Analytics &amp; Diagnostic Data</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use third-party analytics or diagnostic tools to help us
    understand how the app is used and to improve stability and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    These services may automatically collect limited, non-personal information,
    including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and model</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage statistics (such as feature usage)</li>
    <li>Crash or error logs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is collected in an aggregated or anonymized form and does not
    directly identify you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not collect names, email addresses, messages, or any text you enter
    into the app through analytics services.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Internet &amp; IP Address</h2>
  <p>
    Analytics providers may temporarily process anonymized IP addresses for
    diagnostic or regional analysis purposes. We do not store or use IP
    addresses to personally identify users.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Email Communication</h2>
  <p>
    We only receive your email address if you choose to contact us for support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your email is used only to respond to your inquiry and is not shared with
    third parties.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use third-party services (such as analytics or crash reporting
    providers) solely to help improve app performance and reliability.
  </p>
  <p>
    These third-party services are not permitted to use collected data for their
    own purposes beyond providing their service to us.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information processed through the
    app. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100%
    secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under
    the age of 13.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
    reflected on this page. You are encouraged to review it periodically.
